# fEMR-Cleanse-Generator

This standalone web application is created to be used directly with fEMR (https://github.com/FEMR/femr).

### Description

The Cleanse Generator is an intuitive way of cleaning up mispellings and errors within the current medical record database.  Our hopes is this can be expanded to clean future fields.
